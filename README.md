# NavWeather 🌦️

NavWeather is a simple weather application built with React and Vite that allows users
to quickly check current weather conditions and short-term forecasts by city name.

The goal of this project was to understand how frontend applications interact with
real-world APIs and handle dynamic, user-driven data.
